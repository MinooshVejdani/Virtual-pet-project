🐾 Virtual Pet Game

A small browser-based virtual pet game where users interact with a character that responds to different needs like hunger, and happiness. This project helped me practice state changes, working with videos, and organizing logic using object-oriented JavaScript.

🎥 Visuals & Interaction

I used AI tools to create short animations that represent the pet’s emotional states — such as main(idle), eating, sleeping, playing, and weeping. These videos are triggered as the pet’s status changes, giving the app a more lively and engaging experience.

🕹️ Features

- The pet changes states (hungry, sad and dead) automatically over time.
- Users can interact by feeding, playing, or putting the pet to sleep.
- Animations change dynamically.
- All pet behavior is handled through an internal state system.

🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML / CSS** – Layout and styling 
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – Logic, user interaction  
- **Object-Oriented Programming** – Clean, modular code with methods and states

📚 What I Learned

This project helped me:
- Use OOP to structure code around a pet’s changing state
- Work with setInterval
- Work with DOM manipulation and state-driven UI updates
- Trigger video changes based on app logic
